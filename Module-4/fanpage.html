        <h1>Carrie Underwood's Impact</h1>
        <p>
            <h4>Carrie's career took off after winning American Idol in 2005.  I have enjoyed listening to her albums, and some songs are very powerful for me.  The most influential album for me, personally, was her Cry Pretty album.  I repeatedly listened to "The Bullet" and had my own 'therapeutic cry session.'  The album isn't restricted to emotional songs, though.  If you need a 'pick me-up,' try the song Southbound.</h4>
